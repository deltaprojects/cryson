Cryson
------

_[Cappuccino](http://www.cappuccino.org) &hearts; [Java](http://www.java.com) + [Hibernate](http://www.hibernate.org)_

#### What is it?

Cryson is a persistence solution for [Cappuccino](http://www.cappuccino.org) web applications. It uses [Hibernate](http://www.hibernate.org) on the server side and tries to behave somewhat like [Hibernate](http://www.hibernate.org) on the client side as well.

Optionally, Cryson can also help with:

* Serving your Cappuccino application using [Jetty](http://jetty.codehaus.org/jetty/) 
* RESTful web services using [Jersey](http://jersey.java.net)
* Authentication and authorization using [Spring Security](http://www.springsource.org/spring-security/)

#### How do I use it?

Check out the examples! Client API documentation can be generated by issuing 'jake documentation' in the client directory.
